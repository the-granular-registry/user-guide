# Block/Unblock

The registry administrator may block a PEC Issuance at the request of the certification body that certified the underlying EAC, or if any irregularity is noticed with the PEC issuance that requires investigation.

Blocked units cannot be transferred, split, unbundled, or retired until unblocked by the registry administrator.
