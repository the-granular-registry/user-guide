# Issue Similar Application

The issue similar function allows a **Producer Holding Account** to copy a previous issuance and edit only the parts that are different. It is meant to help a user save time while issuing PEC applications that are very similar to previous batches.

Issue similar is accessible on the "Issuance Table" by selecting the unit that you want to copy and clicking on the "Issue Similar" in the top right corner.
