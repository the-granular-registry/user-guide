# Removal and Expiry

## Removal <a href="#removal" id="removal"></a>

The registry administrator can remove units from circulation if a major and unfixable problem is identified with them (for example, they were issued by mistake).

Reach out to the help desk (helpdesk@pec-alliance.org) if you need to remove units from your account.

## Expiry <a href="#expiry" id="expiry"></a>

A PEC will become **expired** once it has passed its validity period.
