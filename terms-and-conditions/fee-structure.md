# Fee Structure

## Fee Types

* Annual Registration Fee. Each generating device registered in the Registry requires a single annual fee. This fee replaces all prior account, subscription, and API access fees.
* No separate account fees (Operator, Trading, End User) are required.
* Registration fees are not pro-rated; the full annual fee is due regardless of the date of registration.
