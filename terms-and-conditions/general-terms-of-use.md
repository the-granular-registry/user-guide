Such events shall excuse performance for the duration of the event and for a reasonable recovery period thereafter.

## Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution

The laws of Texas will govern these Terms of Use, disregarding any conflict of laws principles. Suppose a claim arises concerning these Terms (a “Dispute”). In that case, both you and The Granular Registry will first attempt to settle the matter through mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its active Commercial Mediation Procedures. The party wishing to initiate mediation (the “Demanding Party”) must notify the other party in writing at least thirty (30) days prior, explaining the claim and the intended action amount and providing any relevant supporting documents they may have. Suppose mediation fails to resolve the Dispute within forty-five (45) days from its start. In that case, the issue will proceed to arbitration administered by AAA following its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Online Arbitration in effect. The arbitrator(s) can only award actual damages and have no authority to grant punitive damages or any form of compensation exceeding the actual damages incurred by the prevailing party, nor can they issue decisions that contradict these Terms of Use. Moreover, neither party nor the arbitrator(s) may disclose the details or outcomes of the arbitration without written consent from all parties involved. Each party is responsible for its own expenses related to the resolution of the Dispute, whether through arbitration or court, which may include filing fees, arbitrator costs, and attorney fees. However, if the arbitrator(s) determines that a dispute was initiated in bad faith, the initiating party will be responsible for covering all defense costs of the opposing party.

## Governing Language

These Terms of Use are originally drafted in English. In the event of any discrepancy or conflict between the English version and any translation, the English version shall prevail and control.
