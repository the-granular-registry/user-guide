## Other Purposes and Sharing

The Granular Registry is committed to protecting confidential and non-public information. We do not use or disclose such data except when necessary to deliver or improve our services. This includes standard operational activities such as account management, issuing confirmations and statements, enabling access to data services, and maintaining records.

## Distributing Aggregated and Non-Personal Information

The Granular Registry may share aggregated, anonymized data with third parties. This information does not identify individuals and does not compromise the confidentiality of any personal or transactional data.

## International Users and Data Processing Locations

The Granular Registry processes personal and confidential information on servers located in the United States and other jurisdictions. Data protection standards may vary across these locations and may not always match the levels of protection offered in regions such as the European Union or Switzerland.

The Granular Registry processes personal and confidential information on servers located in the United States and other jurisdictions. Where personal data is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to countries that do not offer an adequate level of data protection, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), or other lawful transfer mechanisms recognized under applicable data protection laws. By submitting personal information, individuals acknowledge that their data may be transferred and processed in accordance with these safeguards and the purposes outlined in this policy.

## Links to Other Websites

The Granular Registry websites may contain links to external third-party resources. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, data handling, or content of these third-party sites. Users are strongly encouraged to review the privacy policies of any linked websites before interacting with them.

## Choices Regarding Collected Information

The Granular Registry collects and uses personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy based on one or more lawful bases, which may include your consent, the necessity of processing for the performance of a contract, compliance with legal obligations, or our legitimate interests, provided such interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms. You may choose not to provide certain personal information; however, doing so may limit our ability to offer specific services or features.

## Data Retention

The Granular Registry retains personal and confidential information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including to comply with legal, regulatory, contractual, and operational obligations.

Where applicable, we determine retention periods based on the following criteria:

* The nature and sensitivity of the data;
* The purpose for which the data was collected;
* Legal or regulatory requirements;
* Contractual obligations with clients or partners;
* The need to maintain accurate business and financial records;
* The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure.

Once data is no longer required for these purposes, it is securely deleted or anonymized in accordance with our data disposal protocols.

Administrative and Marketing Communications: We Do Not Share with Third Parties for Marketing Purposes

The Granular Registry does not disclose confidential or non-public information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. We do not endorse or distribute offers from third-party advertisers and will not share your information with them.

Occasionally, the Granular Registry may use personal or confidential data to inform clients and account holders about our own products or services that may be of interest. If you prefer not to receive such communications, you may opt out by submitting a written request to the address provided in this policy.

Clients and end-user customers agree to receive administrative and service-related communications as part of their relationship with The Granular Registry.

Onward Transfer: Vendor and Supplier Information Sharing

The Granular Registry may share information with trusted third parties, including vendors and suppliers acting on our behalf, or with parties for whom we are collecting data. Such sharing is conducted under strict confidentiality agreements and only for legitimate business purposes.

We require all vendors and suppliers to follow our instructions and comply with appropriate confidentiality and security standards when handling this information.

Access: Your Right to Know and Correct the Information We Hold

The Granular Registry is dedicated to maintaining accurate and current personal information. We encourage clients and end-user customers to notify us promptly of any updates or corrections to their personal data. You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, and to request corrections or deletions of any inaccurate or outdated information. All such requests must be submitted in writing to the address provided in this policy.

In accordance with applicable data protection laws such as the GDPR and CCPA, individuals have the right to:

* Access the personal data we hold about them;

* Not be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produce legal or similarly significant effects.

To exercise any of these rights, please submit a written request to the address provided in this policy. We will respond in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

## Security: Our Commitment to Protecting Information

The Granular Registry employs reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal, confidential, and non-public information. Our information security program outlines standards for securing data under our care.

Access to sensitive information is restricted to employees who require it to perform their duties or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. While we take precautions to secure data transmissions over the Internet, we cannot guarantee complete security. Any information you transmit to us is done at your own risk.

## Security Breach Notification

In the event of a security breach involving personal data, The Granular Registry will notify affected clients or end-user customers without undue delay and, where required by law, within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, in accordance with Article 33 of the GDPR.

Notifications will include:

* A description of the nature of the breach;
* Categories and approximate number of affected individuals and records;
* Likely consequences of the breach;
* Measures taken or proposed to address the breach and mitigate its effects;
* Contact details for further information.

Where notification is required under other laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or similar state regulations, the Granular Registry will comply with applicable timelines and content requirements.

## Children’s Data

The Granular Registry does not knowingly collect or process personal information from children under the age of 13 in the United States, or under the age of 16 in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with similar protections. Our services are not directed at children, and we do not intend for them to be used by individuals under these age thresholds.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child without appropriate parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information promptly in accordance with applicable laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the GDPR provisions concerning children’s data (GDPR-K).

Parents or legal guardians who believe that their child has provided personal information to The Granular Registry without consent may contact us at privacy@granular-registry.com to request deletion or review of the data.
