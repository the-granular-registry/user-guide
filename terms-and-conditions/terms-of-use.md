# Terms of Use

The following are the Terms of Use for the Granular Registry (the “Registry”), operated and administered by The Granular Registry Operations, LLC (“GRO”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Incentive Inc. These Terms of Use are in addition to the [General Terms of Use](general-terms-of-use.md) applicable to your use of the Registry Site. In the event these Terms of Use conflict or are inconsistent with the General Terms of Use, the provisions of these Terms of Use shall control for the services referenced herein.

## 1)    Definitions.

Unless otherwise defined in these Terms of Use or the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used in these Terms of Use shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit A. Any capitalized terms used in these Terms of Use that are not defined herein or in Exhibit A shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Operative Documents.

## 2)    Acceptance of Terms.

&#x20;These Terms of Use, as may be updated from time to time, govern your and your Users' access to and use of the Granular Registry (the "Registry") and the Registry Site (the "Site"). These Terms of Use form a legally binding agreement between you (the "Account Holder") and The Granular Registry Operations, LLC ("GRO," "we," "us," or "our") as the owner and administrator of the Registry. The Account Holder and GRO are each referred to as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." You may review the most current version of these Terms of Use at any time on the Site at docs.granularregistry.com/terms.

&#x20;BY REGISTERING FOR AN ACCOUNT, CLICKING "I ACCEPT" (OR SIMILAR), OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE REGISTRY OR SITE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT: (i) YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND HAVE THE LEGAL CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND ANY ENTITY YOU REPRESENT; (ii) YOU ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM USING THE REGISTRY UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS); AND (iii) ALL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE IS ACCURATE AND COMPLETE. YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, AS MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION, AND YOU AGREE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE BY YOUR AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, OR OTHER USERS ACCESSING THE REGISTRY ON YOUR BEHALF (COLLECTIVELY, YOUR "USERS").

&#x20;You are responsible for ensuring that your Users review and agree to these Terms of Use (e.g., through login acknowledgments or separate agreements) and for their compliance therewith. If you or your Users do not agree to these Terms of Use, you must not access or use the Registry or Site.

&#x20;In addition to these Terms of Use, your use of the Registry is subject to the following documents (collectively, the "Operative Documents"), each as may be modified or restated from time to time and posted on the Site:

a)    The Fee Schedule (available at docs.granularregistry.com/fees);

b)    The General Terms of Use (available at docs.granularregistry.com/general-terms); and

c)     Any other rules, guidelines, operating procedures, or policies posted on the Site from time to time, including the Registry Standard and Procedures (available at docs.granularregistry.com/standards).

&#x20;The Operative Documents are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use and form part of this agreement. In the event of any conflict between these Terms of Use and the Operative Documents, these Terms of Use will control unless the conflicting Operative Document expressly states otherwise. You are responsible for periodically reviewing the Site for updates to these Terms of Use and the Operative Documents.

&#x20;**Modification of Terms and Fees**

&#x20;GRO may modify these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents from time to time. All modifications shall be communicated to the Account Holder in accordance with the notice provisions herein. Material modifications—defined as changes that significantly affect Account Holder’s rights, obligations, or Fees—shall not become effective unless:

1\.     GRO provides at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice via email and/or posting on the Registry Site;

2\.     The Account Holder is allowed at to accept or reject the modification;

3\.     If the Account Holder does not affirmatively accept the modification, the Account Holder may terminate the agreement without penalty before the effective date of the modification, subject to settlement of any outstanding obligations.

&#x20;Continued use of the Registry after the effective date of a material modification shall constitute acceptance of the modified terms. Non-material modifications (e.g., clarifications or administrative updates) shall become effective upon posting.

&#x20;This clause is intended to ensure mutuality of obligation and procedural fairness, and shall not be construed to grant GRO unfettered discretion to alter the material terms of this agreement.

&#x20;

**Material Adverse Change Opt-Out**

&#x20;If any modification to these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents constitutes a Material Adverse Change—defined as a change that materially diminishes the Account Holder’s rights, increases its obligations, or imposes new material restrictions on its use of the Registry—the Account Holder may terminate its Account and these Terms of Use without penalty by providing written notice to GRO within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such modification.

&#x20;For purposes of this Section, a Material Adverse Change includes, but is not limited to:

·       A material increase in Fees not previously disclosed;

·       A reduction in Registry functionality critical to the Account Holder’s operations;

·       A change in data rights or confidentiality obligations that materially limits the Account Holder’s ability to use or protect its submitted data.

&#x20;Termination under this Section shall be effective as of the date the modification would otherwise take effect, and the Account Holder shall remain liable only for Fees incurred up to that date.

&#x20;

## 3)    Description of Service.

The Registry provides an electronic platform for the tracking, management, issuance, transfer, and retirement of Granular Certificates (“GCs”). Each GC is assigned a unique serial number and represents specified Environmental Attributes associated with one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated by an eligible Asset, including but not limited to timestamps, carbon impact metrics, and other granular attributes that enhance or tag underlying Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or similar instruments. Upon GRO’s acceptance of your registration, you will be granted an Account in the Registry to hold, manage, and transact GCs in accordance with these Terms of Use and the Operative Documents. As further detailed in the GCs Standard and Procedures, the Registry aggregates and verifies data to ensure integrity and prevent double-counting, including but not limited to:

a)    generation data derived from Control Area settlement information, obtained from Revenue-Quality Meters and submitted to GRO by a Qualified Reporting Entity or via verified self-reporting, in each case subject to the validation protocols outlined in the GCs Standard and Procedures; and

b)    static asset information provided by Registry Participants, including the Account Holder and its Users, such as fuel type, geographic location, and emissions profiles. GRO implements reasonable measures to verify data accuracy based on submitted information, but does not independently audit or guarantee the completeness or validity of all underlying data beyond the processes described in the Operative Documents.

The Registry is provided solely for tracking and informational purposes to facilitate compliance, reporting, and voluntary market transactions related to Environmental Attributes. It does not constitute legal advice, financial services, or a guarantee of any GC’s validity, market value, or compliance with Applicable Law. Any disputes arising from the use of the Registry or its data—including, without limitation, those related to generation data accuracy, GC transactions, ownership claims, Beneficial Ownership Rights, or any proprietary interests in GCs—must be resolved directly between the Account Holder, other Registry Participants, and any involved third parties. Neither GRO nor the Registry shall intervene in or have liability for such disputes. In the event of a controversy involving disputed GCs, GRO reserves the right, at its discretion, to initiate an interpleader action or similar proceeding and deposit the disputed GCs or related items with the appropriate court or arbitral body, with costs recoverable from the disputing parties where permitted by law. GRO may, but is not obligated to, provide limited assistance in dispute resolution, such as sharing non-confidential data upon mutual request, subject to the confidentiality provisions in Section 14.

GRO reserves the right, in its reasonable discretion, to modify, enhance, reformat, or otherwise update the Registry’s content, functionality, transmission methods, the Operative Documents, or these Terms of Use at any time, including the creation of new versions or features. GRO will not be bound by any provision in the Operative Documents if, in its reasonable judgment, compliance would materially adversely affect the Registry’s operations, security, or integrity, provided that GRO notifies affected Account Holders of such non-compliance within thirty (30) days of its occurrence. For material changes to the Registry, Operative Documents, or these Terms of Use (e.g., those affecting fees, core functionality, or user rights), GRO will provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Account Holders via email, posting on the Registry Site, or other reasonable means. Non-material changes shall be effective upon posting on the Registry Site. Continued use of the Registry following the effective date of any change constitutes your acceptance thereof. Suppose a material change adversely affects your use of the Registry. In that case, you may terminate your Account without penalty by providing written notice to GRO within the notice period, subject to settlement of any outstanding Fees under Section 7.

## 4)    Authorized Users AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT <a href="#bookmark3" id="bookmark3"></a>

&#x20;Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4, (i) “Authorized Users” means the Account Holder’s employees, contractors, consultants, or other representatives who are authorized by the Account Holder to access and use the Registry on the Account Holder’s behalf, subject to the limitations and requirements set forth in these Terms of Use; and (ii) “Agents” means any third-party agents or service providers appointed by the Account Holder to access the Registry on its behalf, such as brokers or aggregators, provided such Agents are bound by a written agreement with the Account Holder that requires compliance with these Terms of Use and the Operative Documents.

&#x20;Account Holder Responsibilities. The Account Holder is solely responsible for: (i) designating and managing its Authorized Users and Agents, including assigning appropriate roles and permissions (e.g., administrator, viewer, or editor) through the tools provided on the Registry Site, consistent with the principle of least privilege; (ii) ensuring that all Authorized Users and Agents agree to and comply with these Terms of Use, the Operative Documents, and all Applicable Laws; (iii) all actions and omissions of its Authorized Users and Agents as if they were the Account Holder’s own; (iv) implementing and enforcing reasonable security measures, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong password policies, and prohibitions on sharing login credentials; (v) promptly notifying GRO of any unauthorized access, security incidents, or changes in Authorized Users or Agents; and (vi) conducting periodic reviews (at least annually) of access rights to ensure they remain appropriate and revoking access as necessary (e.g., upon termination of employment or engagement).

&#x20;Agent Authorization Process. For any Agent, the Account Holder must execute and submit to GRO a Declaration of Agency (“Declaration”) in the form provided on the Registry Site, which shall include the Agent’s agreement to these Terms of Use and any required confidentiality obligations. GRO reserves the right to approve or reject any Declaration in its reasonable discretion. Upon approval, the Agent may access the Account with the permissions granted by the Account Holder. The Account Holder may revoke a Declaration at any time by notifying GRO in writing, after which the Agent’s access shall be terminated promptly.

&#x20;License Restrictions. The rights and licenses granted under these Terms of Use and the Operative Documents are personal to the Account Holder and may be exercised only by the Account Holder and its Authorized Users and approved Agents in connection with the Account Holder’s use of the Registry. Except as expressly permitted in this Section 4, Section 19 (No Assignment, Transfer or Encumbrance by Account Holder), or with respect to Group Retirement Sub-accounts as described in the Operating Procedures, the Account Holder may not transfer, assign, sublicense, or otherwise grant access to its rights, licenses, Account, or any portion thereof to any third party without GRO’s prior written consent. Any unauthorized access or use may result in immediate suspension or termination of the Account pursuant to Section 10.

&#x20;Security and Compliance. The Account Holder shall ensure that all Authorized Users and Agents: (i) use the Registry only for lawful purposes and in accordance with GRO’s security policies (as posted on the Registry Site and updated from time to time); (ii) do not attempt to circumvent, disable, or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Registry; and (iii) comply with data protection obligations under Applicable Law and GRO’s [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md). GRO may monitor access and usage for security, compliance, and operational purposes, and may require additional verification or documentation for high-risk activities, such as GC transfers or retirements.

## 5)    Ownership and Use of Data.

a)    Participant Ownership

&#x20;Registry Participants, including the Account Holder, shall retain all legal and beneficial ownership rights in the data and Confidential Information they submit to the Registry, subject to the licenses granted herein. Such data shall remain the exclusive property of the submitting Participant, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

b)    GRO’s Rights to Use and Aggregate

&#x20;By submitting data to the Registry, the Account Holder grants GRO a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, store, process, and aggregate such data for the purposes of:

* Operating and maintaining the Registry;
* Ensuring data integrity and compliance;
* Generating anonymized and aggregated reports;
* Fulfilling regulatory, audit, and transparency obligations.

&#x20;GRO may include aggregated and anonymized data in public reports or disclosures, provided that such data is de-identified in accordance with Section 14. GRO shall implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to prevent re-identification.

&#x20;

c)     No Transfer of Ownership to GRO

&#x20;Except as expressly provided herein, submission of data to the Registry does not transfer ownership of such data to GRO. GRO shall not claim proprietary rights over Participant-submitted data beyond the limited license granted for operational and compliance purposes.

&#x20;

d)     Data Removal and Retention

&#x20;Data may not be removed from the Registry except in accordance with GRO’s operating procedures or as required by Applicable Law. GRO shall retain submitted data for tracking, audit, and compliance purposes, and shall comply with valid data subject requests under applicable privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), as described in Section 14.

&#x20;&#x20;

## 6)    OWNERSHIP OF GCS; RETAIL AGGREGATORS.

a)    General Prohibition on Third-Party Ownership. Except as expressly permitted under Section 6(b) or otherwise in the Operative Documents, Account Holder represents, warrants, and covenants that: (i) it will only create, hold, transfer, or retire GCs in its Account for which it holds sole legal title and all Beneficial Ownership Rights (as defined in Exhibit A); and (ii) it shall not create, hold, or maintain any Accounts, or create, hold, transfer, or retire any GCs in its Accounts, on behalf of one or more third parties, including without limitation as a trustee, nominee, or intermediary, unless such third-party relationship is explicitly disclosed and approved in writing by GRO in advance.

For the avoidance of doubt, this prohibition is intended to ensure a clear chain of custody for GCs and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent claims related to environmental attributes. Any violation may result in immediate suspension or termination of the Account pursuant to Section 10, forfeiture of affected GCs, and potential reporting to regulatory authorities.

b)    Retail Aggregator Exception. Notwithstanding Section 6(a), an Account Holder designated as a "Retail Aggregator" (as may be approved by GRO during registration or upon request) may retire GCs on behalf of one or more third parties, provided that the following conditions are met at all times: (i) all legal title to and all Beneficial Ownership Rights in any GC retired in a Group Retirement Sub-account must be held solely by one or more individuals or organizations (collectively, an “Owner”) that have provided the Account Holder with verifiable written authorization (in a form acceptable to GRO, such as the template provided in the GCs Standard and Procedures) to: (A) retire such GC on the Owner's behalf; (B) provide any necessary data or information relating to such GC to GRO; and (C) represent that the Owner has no conflicting claims or obligations with respect to the GC (e.g., no prior transfers or retirements). The authorization must be current, revocable only in writing, and retained by the Account Holder for at least seven (7) years from the date of retirement or as required by Applicable Law, whichever is longer; (ii) any retirement of GCs in a Group Retirement Sub-account shall be effected solely on behalf of, and for the exclusive benefit of, the applicable Owner, with no commingling of GCs from unauthorized sources; (iii) the Account Holder shall promptly notify GRO in writing of any revocation or expiration of an Owner's authorization and shall not retire any affected GCs thereafter; (iv) the Account Holder shall maintain accurate records of all such retirements, including copies of authorizations, Owner identities (subject to privacy protections under Section 14 and the [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md)), and transaction details, and make such records available to GRO upon request for audit or verification purposes; and (v) the Account Holder shall not charge Owners fees or impose terms that conflict with these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents without disclosing such to GRO.

GRO reserves the right, in its reasonable discretion, to review, request copies of, or verify any authorizations or records under this Section 6(b) prior to or after any retirement. If GRO determines that any condition herein is not met, it may reject, reverse, or suspend the retirement, and the Account Holder shall indemnify GRO for any resulting Losses pursuant to Section 18. This exception does not permit Account Holders to hold or transfer GCs on behalf of third parties outside of retirements in Group Retirement Sub-accounts.

&#x20;

## 7)    FEES.

a)    Account Holder agrees to pay all fees and costs charged by GRO for use of the Registry and related services (collectively, the “Fees”), as set forth in the then-current Fee Schedule posted on the Registry Site or as otherwise specified in an applicable order form or agreement between the Parties. Fees may include, without limitation, subscription fees, account setup fees, transaction-based fees (e.g., for GC creation, transfer, or retirement), and any other charges outlined in the Fee Schedule. All Fees are exclusive of applicable Taxes, which shall be handled in accordance with Section 8.

b)    GRO reserves the right to modify the Fees (including introducing new fees or changing the structure of existing Fees) in its sole discretion, provided that GRO provides Account Holder with at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of any such modification. If the modification results in a material increase in Fees (defined as an increase of more than \[10]% above the then-current Fees for comparable services), Account Holder may terminate its Account and these Terms of Use without penalty by providing written notice to GRO within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the modification. In such event, termination shall be effective as of the date the Fee modification would otherwise take effect, and Account Holder shall remain liable only for Fees incurred up to that date.

c)     Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents (e.g., prorated refunds for prepaid Fees in the event of termination by GRO without cause under Section 10(b)(iv)), all Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, including upon termination or suspension of these Terms of Use, any Account, or any Sub-account. For clarity, no refunds will be issued for unused portions of prepaid Fees unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

## 8)    Payments and Taxes. <a href="#bookmark9" id="bookmark9"></a>

a)    Invoicing and Payment. Invoices for Fees will be sent electronically and posted on a secure page on the Registry Site. Invoicing will commence on the effective date of the applicable Account or Order (as defined in the Operative Documents). Unless otherwise specified in the Fee Schedule or an applicable Order, undisputed Fees shall be due and payable by Account Holder within thirty (30) days of the date of GRO's invoice (the "Due Date"). Account Holder shall pay all Fees in United States dollars (or such other currency as specified in an Order) via check, wire transfer, ACH, credit card, or other electronic payment method, using immediately available funds, to the account or payment processor identified by GRO from time to time, without any offset, deduction, or reduction of any kind. If Account Holder provides GRO with electronic payment information (e.g., credit card or ACH details), Account Holder authorizes GRO to charge such method for all Fees due hereunder. Fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable, except in cases of overpayment due to GRO's error, in which case GRO will promptly refund the excess amount upon verification. Account Holder is responsible for all transaction fees, including wire transfer or credit card processing fees. Any disputes regarding Fees or invoices must be notified to GRO in writing within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date, specifying the disputed amount and reasons; failure to do so deems the invoice accepted. During a good-faith dispute, Account Holder must pay all undisputed amounts by the Due Date. If Account Holder fails to pay undisputed Fees by the Due Date, GRO may, upon ten (10) days' written notice, charge interest on overdue amounts at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, whichever is lower), prorated daily from the Due Date until paid in full. Account Holder shall also reimburse GRO for all reasonable costs of collection, including attorneys' fees and court costs. If payment remains overdue for thirty (30) days after the Due Date, GRO may, in its sole discretion and upon additional notice, suspend Account Holder's access to the Registry until all past-due amounts, interest, and collection costs are paid in full. Suspension does not relieve Account Holder of its payment obligations.

b)    Taxes. All Fees are exclusive of, and Account Holder is solely responsible for, all applicable sales, use, value-added (VAT), goods and services (GST), consumption, withholding, excise, personal property, or other taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, or similar charges imposed by any governmental entity (collectively, "Taxes"), excluding only Taxes based solely on GRO's net income. If any Taxes are required to be withheld from payments to GRO, Account Holder shall (i) gross up such payments so that GRO receives the full amount of Fees as if no withholding had occurred, and (ii) promptly provide GRO with official receipts or other evidence from the relevant taxing authority confirming payment of such Taxes. Account Holder may provide GRO with a valid tax exemption certificate or other satisfactory proof of exemption, in which case GRO will not charge or collect the exempted Taxes. If GRO is required to pay or collect any Taxes for which Account Holder is responsible, such Taxes will be added to Account Holder's invoices and paid by Account Holder. If not added to an invoice, such Taxes remain Account Holder's exclusive responsibility. Account Holder agrees to indemnify GRO for any Taxes (including penalties and interest) arising from Account Holder's failure to pay or withhold Taxes as required hereunder.

## 9)    reserved <a href="#bookmark10" id="bookmark10"></a>

## 10) Term and Termination. <a href="#bookmark11" id="bookmark11"></a>

a)    Term.

These Terms of Use become effective on the date the Account Holder accepts them via the Registry Site (the “Effective Date”) and shall remain in effect until terminated by either Party in accordance with this Section.

b)    Termination by GRO.

i)      Rejection of Registration. Prior to accepting Account Holder’s registration to become an Account Holder, GRO may, in its sole discretion, reject the registration and deny access to the Registry immediately, with or without providing a reason.

ii)     Termination for Cause. GRO may terminate Account Holder’s access to the Registry for cause if Account Holder is in Default pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof. For Defaults under Section 11(a)(i), GRO shall provide Account Holder with written notice specifying the Default and a reasonable opportunity to cure (not less than thirty (30) days from receipt of notice, unless the Default cannot reasonably be cured within such period, in which case Account Holder shall commence cure within such period and diligently pursue it to completion). If the Default is not cured within the cure period, termination shall be effective five (5) days after a subsequent notice of termination. For Defaults under Sections 11(a)(ii) through 11(a)(ix), GRO may terminate access immediately upon written notice to Account Holder.

iii)   Termination for Convenience. GRO may terminate Account Holder’s access to the Registry for any reason or no reason by providing at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to Account Holder.

c)     Termination by Account Holder. Account Holder may terminate its use of the Registry for any reason or no reason by providing at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to GRO. Account Holder may also terminate immediately upon written notice if GRO materially breaches these Terms of Use and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach.

d)    Termination Required by Law. Either Party shall terminate access to or cease use of the Registry (as applicable) if required by any Applicable Law, or by any order or decision of a court of law, arbitral panel, or governmental agency. The terminating Party shall provide the other Party with as much prior written notice as practicable under the circumstances, but in no event less than the minimum notice period required by Applicable Law or the relevant order (or sixty (60) days if no shorter period is specified). The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize disruption and comply with such requirements.

e) Effects of Termination.

i) Disposition of GCs

1. The Account Holder shall have a grace period of thirty (30) days (or longer if specified in the notice) to retire, transfer, or otherwise manage any GCs held in its accounts.
2. After the grace period, GRO may retire any remaining GCs to prevent double-counting or loss of environmental integrity, without liability to the Account Holder.

ii) Outstanding Fees

1. The Account Holder remains liable for all accrued and unpaid fees as of the termination date.
2. No refunds shall be issued for unused portions of prepaid fees unless expressly provided in the fee schedule or required by law.

iii) Data Handling

1. The Account Holder may request export of non-confidential data during the grace period, subject to applicable fees.
2. GRO shall retain data as required by law and comply with valid data deletion requests per its privacy policy.

iv) Survival of Obligations

1. The following provisions shall survive termination:

a. Ownership and Use of Data (Section 5)

b. Fees and Taxes (Sections 7–8)

c. Confidentiality (Section 14)

d. Indemnification (Section 18)

e. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution (Section 26)

f. Any other provisions that by their nature are intended to survive.

v) Transition Assistance

1. At the Account Holder’s request and expense, GRO shall provide reasonable assistance for data and GC transition for up to thirty (30) days post-termination.

f) Reinstatement.

i) Discretionary Reinstatement. Upon Account Holder’s written request, GRO may, in its reasonable discretion, reinstate Account Holder’s access to the registry after termination for Account Holder’s default, provided that (i) Account Holder has fully cured the default to GRO’s satisfaction, (ii) Account Holder has paid all outstanding fees (including any late payments or taxes), and (iii) Account Holder pays a reasonable reinstatement fee not to exceed the prorated fees that would have accrued during the termination period (the “Reinstatement Fee”). The Reinstatement Fee shall be due prior to reinstatement.

ii) Required Reinstatement. GRO shall reinstate Account Holder’s access to the registry if directed to do so as a result of a final, binding outcome in a dispute resolution proceeding under Section 26 of these terms of use. In such case, whether a Reinstatement Fee is required (and its amount) shall be determined as part of the dispute resolution proceeding.

&#x20;

## 11) Default; Remedies. <a href="#bookmark16" id="bookmark16"></a>

a)    Events of Default. Each of the following shall constitute an "Event of Default" by a Party (in such capacity, the "Defaulting Party") under these Terms of Use:

i)      The Defaulting Party fails to perform any material obligation under these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents (other than those specified in clauses (ii) through (x) below), and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days (or five (5) days if the failure relates to a payment obligation under Sections 7, 8, or 9) after receipt of written notice from the other Party (the "Non-Defaulting Party") specifying the default in reasonable detail;

ii)     The Account Holder fails to pay any Fees, Taxes, Reinstatement Fees, or other amounts due under these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents within five (5) days after the Due Date;

iii)   The Account Holder or its Users or Agents tamper with, alter, damage, destroy, or attempt to reverse engineer (A) the Registry, the Software, or any portion thereof, or (B) any data, GCs, or information belonging to other Registry Participants or third parties;

iv)   The Defaulting Party uses the Registry or any GCs in a manner that violates any Applicable Law, including but not limited to environmental, securities, anti-corruption, data protection, or export control laws;

v)     The Defaulting Party becomes insolvent, admits in writing its inability to pay debts as they become due, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar proceeding (and, if involuntary, such petition is not dismissed within sixty (60) days), has a receiver, trustee, or liquidator appointed for all or substantially all of its assets (and such appointment is not vacated within thirty (30) days), or undergoes dissolution, liquidation, or winding up (if an entity);

vi)   The Account Holder submits, or causes to be submitted, any falsified, misrepresented, inaccurate, or incomplete data or information to the Registry, including but not limited to generation data, Asset details, or Environmental Attributes;

vii)  The Defaulting Party makes any materially false or misleading representation or warranty in these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents;

viii)  The Defaulting Party breaches its confidentiality obligations under Section 14;

ix)   The Account Holder breaches any data security or privacy obligations, including unauthorized access, disclosure, or processing of Confidential Information or personal data in violation of Applicable Law or the Privacy Policy;

x)     The Account Holder receives written notice of violation of any material term or condition of these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents three (3) or more times within any twelve (12)-month period, regardless of whether such violations are cured; or

xi)   Any other event specified as an Event of Default in the Operative Documents.

b)    Remedies.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and subject to any applicable cure periods, the Non-Defaulting Party may exercise any rights and remedies available at law or in equity, including but not limited to termination or suspension as provided in Section 10. Without limiting the foregoing, GRO shall have the following additional rights and remedies, which may be exercised singly or in combination, with or without further notice (except as required by Applicable Law):

i)      Suspend or restrict the Account Holder's access to the Registry or any Account, in whole or in part, pending cure of the default;

ii)     Correct, remove, or retire any erroneously issued or transferred GCs, notify affected parties (including purchasers or regulators) of such actions, and impose reasonable administrative fines or penalties as set forth in the Fee Schedule or GCs Standard and Procedures;

iii)   Seek monetary damages, including recovery of all Fees, Taxes, costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents;

iv)   Obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, without the need to post a bond or prove irreparable harm, to prevent or remedy breaches, including violations of intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, or data integrity; the Account Holder acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate for such breaches and waives any defense to the contrary;

v)     Forfeit any GCs held in the Account Holder's Accounts upon termination, subject to the Account Holder's right to transfer or retire them prior to the effective date of termination as provided in Section 10(e); and

vi)   Report the default to relevant regulatory authorities if required by Applicable Law or if necessary to protect the integrity of the Registry or GCs.

All remedies are cumulative and not exclusive. Upon termination due to the Account Holder's default, the Account Holder shall remain liable for all accrued obligations, including payment of any outstanding amounts and GRO's enforcement costs.

c)     Non-Waiver of Defaults.

No failure or delay by the Non-Defaulting Party in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents shall constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving Party. Receipt by GRO of any partial payment shall not constitute an accord and satisfaction or waiver of any default.

&#x20;

## 12) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

a)    Ownership and Rights.

The Registry, the Software, all GCs (including their unique serial numbers and associated data), the GRO name, brand, logos, and all content, data structures, algorithms, and materials in or generated by the Registry are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws. GRO (or its licensors) owns and retains all right, title, and interest in and to such intellectual property, including any modifications, enhancements, or derivatives thereof. Except for the limited licenses expressly granted in these Terms of Use, no express or implied rights or licenses are granted to the Account Holder under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights.

b)    Restrictions on Use.

Except as expressly permitted by these Terms of Use, the Operative Documents, or Applicable Law, the Account Holder shall not, and shall not permit its Users or Agents to:

**b)** The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 13 shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms of Use for a period of three (3) years.

**c)** DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OF USE, GRO MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

&#x20;

## 14) Confidentiality. <a href="#bookmark22" id="bookmark22"></a>

a) **Mutual Obligations.** Each Party (as the "Receiving Party") agrees to hold in confidence and not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information received from the other Party (as the "Disclosing Party") or otherwise obtained in connection with the use of the Registry, except as expressly permitted by these Terms of Use, the Operative Documents, or the Registry’s Privacy Policy. The Receiving Party shall use at least the same degree of care to protect the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, agents, contractors, or affiliates who have a need to know such information for the purposes permitted hereunder and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those herein. GRO further agrees to handle all information provided by Account Holder in accordance with the Registry’s Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where applicable, and any similar state or federal laws. Account Holder agrees not to use or disclose any Confidential Information of other Registry Participants except as authorized. The obligations of confidentiality under this Section 14 shall survive termination or expiration of these Terms of Use for a period of five (5) years, except with respect to trade secrets, which shall remain confidential indefinitely so long as they qualify as trade secrets under applicable law.

b) **Definition of Confidential Information.** As used in these Terms of Use, "Confidential Information" means any non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information disclosed by one Party to the other in connection with the Registry, including but not limited to:

i) Gross and net generation (MWhs) of each electricity Generating Unit;

ii) Electricity (MWhs) consumed on site by the Generating Unit owner or other on-site customer, other than for Generating Unit use (monthly);

iii) Street address of the Generating Unit;

iv) If aggregate metering of Generating Units, number and names of Generating Units on the meter;

v) Capacity factor of each electricity Generating Unit;

vi) Total number of GCs in Account Holder’s Account and any sub-account thereof, including without limitation each Group Retirement Sub-account;

vii) The amount and timing of specific GC transfers, including transfers from one Account Holder to another and transfers among the sub-accounts of an Account Holder; and

viii) Those portions of communications between Account Holder and GRO regarding the Registry that contain any of the aforementioned information.

Provided, however, that Confidential Information does not include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by written documentation: (1) was publicly known and generally available prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (2) becomes publicly known and generally available after disclosure through no fault of the Receiving Party; (3) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality and with the right to disclose; (4) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; (5) is required to be disclosed by Applicable Law, regulation, court order, or governmental authority, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice (where permitted by law) to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other remedy, and discloses only the minimum information necessary; or (6) is information that GRO is otherwise permitted to disclose under the GCs Standard and Procedures or for the operation of the Registry in an aggregated and anonymized form as described in subsection (c) below.

c)    Aggregation and Public Reports. Confidential Information may be aggregated with other information in the Registry and included in public reports, as more fully described in the GCs Standard and Procedures, provided that such aggregation is performed in a manner that ensures the data is anonymized and de-identified such that no third party could reasonably reverse-engineer or attribute the aggregated information to a specific Account Holder or Registry Participant. GRO shall implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to prevent re-identification of aggregated data.

d)    Ownership. Confidential Information remains the sole and exclusive property of the Disclosing Party or the Registry Participant who provided it (or on whose behalf it was provided). The Receiving Party acquires no rights, title, or interest in the Confidential Information except the limited right to use it as expressly permitted herein for the purposes set forth in the Operative Documents and these Terms of Use.

e)    Unauthorized Access. If the Account Holder obtains access to data in the Registry that: (i) is not data provided or owned by the Account Holder; (ii) is not part of a publicly available Registry report; and (iii) the Account Holder is not otherwise authorized to access or use, then, regardless of whether such data qualifies as Confidential Information, the Account Holder shall: (A) immediately notify GRO in writing of such access; and (B) not disclose, disseminate, copy, or use any such information. GRO reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate action, including suspension or termination of the Account, in response to any such unauthorized access.

f)     Limited Obligations of GRO. Except as specifically set forth in this Section 14 or the Registry’s Privacy Policy, GRO shall have no obligation to protect or maintain the confidentiality of any information provided by Account Holder to GRO or the Registry. Account Holder expressly consents to the disclosure and use of any information that does not qualify as Confidential Information hereunder, provided such disclosure complies with applicable laws.

g)    Remedies for Breach. In the event of any actual or threatened breach of this Section 14, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available at law, without the need to post a bond or prove actual damages, as a breach may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages alone would be inadequate. The Receiving Party agrees to reimburse the Disclosing Party for all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing this Section 14.

## 15) Disclaimer of Warranty.

The Registry and its associated software and services are provided by GRO on an “as is” and “as available” basis. While GRO endeavors to source data from entities it reasonably believes to be reliable—including Control Area Operators, Qualified Reporting Entities, Registry Participants, and Account Holders—GRO makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of any data contained in the Registry. GRO does not independently audit or verify the data submitted by third parties and disclaims any obligation to do so.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, GRO expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties arising from course of dealing, usage, or trade practice. GRO does not warrant that the Registry or its software will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free from vulnerabilities, nor that any defects will be corrected.

GRO shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in data submitted by Account Holders, Registry Participants, or other third parties, nor for any decisions made or actions taken based on such data. Account Holders are solely responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of their own systems, including login credentials and network infrastructure. GRO shall not be responsible for any damages resulting from breaches or failures in the Account Holder’s own systems, and no offsets or deductions from Fees shall be permitted on such grounds.

This disclaimer is a fundamental part of the Terms of Use and reflects the shared responsibility model under which the Registry operates.

## 16) Limitation of Liability.

a) Liability Cap

To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, GRO’s total cumulative liability arising out of or related to the Registry, its services, or these Terms of Use—whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise—shall be limited to the greater of:

i) the total Fees paid by the Account Holder to GRO in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or

ii) the total Fees paid by the Account Holder in the calendar year in which the claim is made.

b) Exclusions from Liability Cap

The foregoing limitation shall not apply to:

i) Claims arising from a Party’s fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence;

ii) Breach of confidentiality obligations under Section 14;

iii) Infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights;

iv) Indemnification obligations under Section 18.

c) Disclaimer of Consequential Damages

In no event shall either Party be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or reputational harm, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

&#x20;The Account Holder acknowledges and accepts full responsibility for its use of the Registry and its outputs, including any risks associated with data input, interpretation, or reliance. GRO disclaims liability for inaccuracies in third-party data and for breaches in the Account Holder’s own systems.

## 17) Logins, Passwords and Registry IDs.

Account Holder Responsibilities

* Ensure confidentiality and security of all login credentials and Registry IDs.
* Use safeguards like MFA, strong passwords, and regular access reviews.
* Prevent sharing of credentials; limit to Authorized Users.
* Notify GRO promptly of any unauthorized access or misuse.
* Cooperate with GRO in addressing security incidents.
* GRO may suspend access for breaches or misuse per terms and policies.

## 18) Indemnification. <a href="#bookmark25" id="bookmark25"></a>

&#x20;Account Holder Indemnification Obligations. The Account Holder agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless GRO, its affiliates, subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, and representatives (“GRO Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:

1\.     Any violation of Applicable Law by the Account Holder or its Users;

2\.     Any breach of these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents;

3\.     Any inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading data submitted to the Registry;

4\.     Any unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of the Registry or its data by the Account Holder or its Users;

5\.     Any reliance on or use of Registry data by the Account Holder or its Users in a manner not permitted under these Terms of Use.

&#x20;This indemnity shall not apply to the extent that a final judicial or arbitral determination finds that the GRO Indemnified Party’s conduct constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct.

&#x20;GRO Indemnification Obligations. GRO agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Account Holder, its Users, and its Agents (“Account Holder Indemnified Parties”) from and against any third-party claims arising out of or related to:

1\.     GRO’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under these Terms of Use;

2\.     GRO’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;

3\.     GRO’s violation of Applicable Law in connection with the operation of the Registry;

4\.     Any unauthorized disclosure or data breach caused by GRO’s failure to implement or maintain reasonable security measures;

5\.     Any claim that the Registry or its Software infringes valid intellectual property rights or misappropriates trade secrets.

&#x20;The Account Holder must promptly notify GRO in writing of any such claim. GRO retains sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim, and the Account Holder must cooperate reasonably in the defense, at GRO’s expense.

&#x20;Exclusions\
GRO shall have no liability for infringement claims to the extent they result from:

·       Modifications to the Registry or Software not made or authorized by GRO;

·       Unauthorized or non-compliant use of the Registry or Software;

·       Use in combination with third-party systems not provided by GRO, where the claim would not have arisen but for such combination;

·       Use of the Registry or Software in violation of these Terms of Use.

&#x20;

## 19) No Assignment, Transfer or Encumbrance by Account Holder. <a href="#bookmark27" id="bookmark27"></a>

&#x20;The Account Holder may not assign, delegate, sublicense, pledge, encumber, or otherwise transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by merger, operation of law, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of GRO. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be null and void. GRO may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms of Use without restriction, provided such assignment does not materially diminish the Account Holder’s rights.

## 20) Relationship of Parties.

Each Party is acting as an independent contractor and not as an agent, partner, joint venturer, or fiduciary of the other Party. Nothing in these Terms of Use shall be construed to create any relationship of agency, partnership, joint venture, or fiduciary duty between the Parties. Neither Party shall have authority to bind the other or incur obligations on behalf of the other without prior written consent.

## 21) No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

These Terms of Use and the Operative Documents are intended solely for the benefit of GRO and the Account Holder, and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided in the Indemnification section, no third party—including any entity with Beneficial Ownership Rights in a Granular Certificate—shall have any rights or remedies under or in connection with these Terms of Use or the Operative Documents.

## 22) Force Majeure.

&#x20;Neither Party shall be liable for any delay, failure in performance, or interruption of service caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes, utility failures, cyberattacks, pandemics, or failures of third-party telecommunications or hosting services. The affected Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of such events and resume performance as soon as practicable. However, such events shall not excuse the Account Holder’s obligation to pay any Fees due under these Terms of Use by the applicable Due Date.

## 23) Severability.

&#x20;Suppose any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction. In that case, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid one that most closely reflects the original intent.

## &#x20;24) WAIVER.

&#x20;No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving Party. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach, nor shall it affect the right of either Party to enforce any provision thereafter.

## 25) Notices.

&#x20;All notices required or permitted under these Terms of Use must be in writing and delivered by personal delivery, email, or other electronic means as specified below:

* If to GRO:\
  Granular Registry Operations, LLC\
  Email: info@cleanincentive.com
* If to Account Holder:\
  To the email or physical address provided during registration, as updated by the Account Holder from time to time.

Notices shall be deemed received upon actual delivery. For email notices, receipt is deemed effective upon acknowledgment by the receiving Party. Each Party is responsible for maintaining current contact information for notice purposes.

## 26) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

&#x20;These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

&#x20;In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the Registry (“Dispute”), the Parties agree to first attempt to resolve the matter through good-faith mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its then-current Commercial Mediation Procedures. The Party initiating mediation (“Demanding Party”) must provide written notice to the other Party at least thirty (30) days prior to commencement, including a description of the claim, the relief sought, and any supporting documentation.

&#x20;Suppose the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within forty-five (45) days of its initiation. In that case, it shall be submitted to binding arbitration administered by AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Online Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by one or more arbitrators with experience in commercial and technology-related matters. The arbitrators may award only actual damages and shall not award punitive, consequential, or speculative damages. The arbitrators shall not have authority to alter or disregard the provisions of these Terms of Use.

&#x20;All arbitration proceedings, including the existence and outcome of the Dispute, shall remain confidential unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the mediation and arbitration, including legal fees, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim was brought in bad faith, in which case the initiating Party shall be responsible for the opposing Party’s reasonable costs and expenses.

## 27) Service Level Agreement (SLA)

a) Uptime Commitment

GRO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Registry is available at least 99.5% of the time, measured monthly, excluding:

i) Scheduled maintenance (with at least 48 hours’ prior notice),

ii) High-priority issues (e.g., GC transaction failures): initial response within 1 business day.

iii) Routine inquiries: response within 3 business days.

c) Remedies

If GRO fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 27.1 for two consecutive months, the Account Holder may:

ii) Terminate the agreement without penalty upon thirty (30) days’ written notice if uptime falls below 95% for any three months in a rolling six-month period.

Service credits must be requested in writing within thirty (30) days of the end of the affected month and will be applied to future invoices. Service credits are the Account Holder’s sole remedy for SLA violations.

d) Exclusions

This SLA does not apply to:

ii) Issues caused by third-party integrations not provided or certified by GRO,

iii) Failures resulting from Account Holder’s breach of these Terms of Use.

## 28) Audit Rights

a)    GRO Audit Rights

GRO shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to audit the Account Holder’s use of the Registry to verify compliance with these Terms of Use and the Operative Documents. Such audits may include, but are not limited to:

* Review of GC transaction records, authorizations, and supporting documentation;
* Verification of data accuracy and completeness;
* Inspection of security protocols and access controls;
* Confirmation of compliance with Beneficial Ownership Rights and third-party authorizations.

&#x20;GRO may conduct audits remotely or on-site, and may engage independent third-party auditors bound by confidentiality obligations. The Account Holder shall cooperate in good faith and provide timely access to relevant records, systems, and personnel. GRO shall bear the cost of routine audits unless the audit reveals material non-compliance, in which case the Account Holder shall reimburse GRO for reasonable audit costs.

&#x20;b)     Participant Transparency Rights

To promote transparency and trust, GRO may, at its discretion, allow Account Holders to request limited audit access to GRO’s Registry operations solely for the purpose of verifying:

* The integrity of GC issuance and retirement processes;
* GRO’s adherence to published standards and procedures;
* Aggregated system-level data accuracy.

&#x20;Such requests must be submitted in writing and may be granted subject to GRO’s confidentiality obligations, security protocols, and operational constraints. GRO reserves the right to deny or limit such access if it would compromise proprietary information, third-party confidentiality, or system integrity.

## 29) Entire Agreement.

&#x20;These Terms of Use, together with the Operative Documents and any exhibits or schedules incorporated herein by reference, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements, representations, or communications relating to such subject matter.
